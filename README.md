# KNN-Identification-codes
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The algorithm can be used to identify the verification code<br/><br/>
These code can identify the verification image.The source code contains two folders. If you want to run the code, you must change some settings to fit your actural running environment.
<h2>Code</h2>
Firstly, you should change the file <code>./src/testToken/TokenTest.py</code>. The default path is <code>g:/machine/kNN-dataSet</code>, and you can change this to any path you want. You should create some other folders to hold the verification image:<code>./your Folder/token</code> to hold the verification image comming from the Internet, <code>./your Folder/new</code> to hold the verification image processed by code, <code>./your Folder/alphabet</code> to hold the dataSet generated by code. While all the contents of the folders above are generated by code, you just need to create the folders.<br/><br/>
If you finish the steps above, you can run the code. The main program is <code>./src/testToken/TokenTest.py</code>, you can run it by reading the code comments.<br/><br/>
By the way, the file <code>./src/testToken/WebTest.py</code> can be runned without and changing of the settings.

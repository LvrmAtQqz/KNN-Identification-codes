# KNN-Identification-codes
The algorithm can be used to identify the verification code

These code can identify the verification image.The source code contains two folders. If you want to run the code, you must change some settings to fit your actural running environment.
Firstly, you should change the file ./src/testToken/TokenTest.py. The default path is g:/machine/kNN-dataSet, and you can change this to any path you want. You should create some other folders to hold the verification image:./your Folder/token to hold the verification image comming from the Internet, ./your Folder/new to hold the verification image processed by code, ./your Folder/alphabet to hold the dataSet generated by code. While all the contents of the folders above are generated by code, you just need to create the folders.
If you finish the steps above, you can run the code. The main program is ./src/testToken/TokenTest.py, you can run it by reading the code comments.
